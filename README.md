# Battleship-ONLINE-Server
This is the source code for the server running on Heroku.com that handles all traffic from oops-studio.com/battleshiponline. Please feel free to give me pointers and suggestions on how I could improve this! Also, please note that I am very currently working on this. It will probably be updated frequently, and suggestions from you guys are my #1 priority!
