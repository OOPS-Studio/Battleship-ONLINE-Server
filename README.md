# Battleship-ONLINE-Server
This is the source code for the server running on Heroku.com that handles all traffic from <a href = "http://oops-studio.com/battleshiponline">oops-studio.com/battleshiponline</a>. Please feel free to give me pointers and suggestions on how I could improve this! Also, please note that I am very currently working on this. It will probably be updated frequently, and suggestions from you guys are my #1 priority!

Play the game <a href = "http://oops-studio.com/battleshiponline">here</a>! (Note: The web server may be shut down right now.)
